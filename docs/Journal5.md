## What is your project idea?

A website where text(mainly news articles) can be uploaded and is scanned to see if it has a political bias, either to the right or left. I want it to also show on a scale how much of a bias the text has. 

## What is your mvp?

My minimal viable product includes two things: a website where text can be uploaded on the frontend and on the backend having a model scan the text and provide an output. 


## What is your proof of concept?

I have two proof of concepts: 
  1. Website I can put text into 
  2. Language model that can scan provide some kind of output from text 

## What are nice to haves?

The nice to haves for this project are a ranking system that ranks how big the bias is to the left or right.
