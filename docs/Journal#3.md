# Journal #3

## POV's

The POV statements we wrote really helped me start this process. I was able to condense my interview experience into just 3 short sentences. This helped me see the real problem that they had, so I could tell what they needed to fix.

## HMW

By creating "How might we?" questions we take the core of the POV statements and try and phrase a statement to solve their probles without making the question lead to a answer.

## Experience Prototypes

I actually really enjoyed the experience prototypes I've done so far. My first experience prototype I did was meant to test my assumption that sport games aren't interested without prior knowledge. To test this I had Asher, a participant, watch a clip of a sports game then give feedback on it. Then I gave him information about the clip and had hiim give feedback.
