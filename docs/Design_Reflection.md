# Design Reflection

## Needfinding
There are tons of things in our everyday lives that bug us. Needfinding is being aware of those things and writing them down. Then when presenting those bugs to others we can see if they also affect other people's lives and to what degree. By drawing out our bugs and providing a short description in writing or verbally people are able to more easily understand the problem and have an easier time connecting with the idea.

## Defining
We defined the bugs into a question, “How might we”, which allowed us to think about what the problem is. But by making our ”How might me” questions broad we allow for many things to be the solution to our problem. The wording of the question is extremely important because certain keywords or the way the question is phrased can give people a bias in how they come up with ideas to solve the problem.

## Ideating
Using our “How might we” questions, we came up with as many solutions as possible in a short time. This forced us to just come up with wacky and silly ideas. But after we grouped our ideas we came upon common themes in the ideas. The common themes can help us to come up with more solid, creative, or realistic ideas to then prototype. 

## Prototyping
After coming up with an idea we built small prototypes. These prototypes were meant to give us feedback on how good our ideas were. It also allowed us to see if there were any problems, allowing us to iterate on our prototypes. Then with the knowledge we gained from prototyping we can begin to work on the actual product or service. Or if the prototype was bad we can rethink the solution to our problem with some insight from past prototypes.
