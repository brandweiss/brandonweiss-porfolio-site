# Design Reflection

## Needfinding
There are tons of things in our everyday lives that bug us. Needfinding is being aware of those things and writing them down. Then when presenting those bugs to others we can see if they also affect other people's lives and to what degree. By drawing out our bugs and providing a short description in writing or verbally people are able to more easily understand the problem and have an easier time connecting with the idea.

I personally had some trouble coming up with things that I get annoyed by. I think its because when something annoys me I either try and find a way of solving it or just learn to live with it. But, I found the things that really annoy tend to be things that I can control. For example the actions of others, like when I' driving and someone cuts me off. 

## Defining
We defined the bugs into a question, “How might we”, which allowed us to think about what the problem is. But by making our ”How might me” questions broad we allow for many things to be the solution to our problem. The wording of the question is extremely important because certain keywords or the way the question is phrased can give people a bias in how they come up with ideas to solve the problem.

At first I either made the questions to broad or to specific. I had trouble finding the balance between these two extrtemes. But I quickly picked up that to get the question where you want it you have to find the root of the problem. I also founf that I had to ask it as a question without leading people to one asnwer.

## Ideating
Using our “How might we” questions, we came up with as many solutions as possible in a short time. This forced us to just come up with wacky and silly ideas. But after we grouped our ideas we came upon common themes in the ideas. The common themes can help us to come up with more solid, creative, or realistic ideas to then prototype. 

I had a lot of fun coming up with ideas for the problems we covered in class. However I did get easily distracted by coming up with to many silly/wacky and unrealistic ideas. But I enjoyed the process and believed that it did help the class come up with some unique answers to some of our problems.

## Prototyping
After coming up with an idea we built small prototypes. These prototypes were meant to give us feedback on how good our ideas were. It also allowed us to see if there were any problems, allowing us to iterate on our prototypes. Then with the knowledge we gained from prototyping we can begin to work on the actual product or service. Or if the prototype was bad we can rethink the solution to our problem with some insight from past prototypes.
